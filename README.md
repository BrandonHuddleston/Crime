# Find It App
An app that lets you search a city and find things in that city.  You can search for Restaurants, Shopping Malls, Bars, Hotels, or any listing from the dropdown menu.

After researching many APIâ€™s, and getting good responses from places and maps, we pulled the information together and decided to use a places search within cities

How to use the project
---
On Find It! the user can search a city and look up different Places of Interest depending on what they are looking to do around the city. For example the user is looking for a place to stay in the city of Charlotte. All they would have to do is type "Charlotte" in the search bar and just select "Hotels" from the dropdown menu.
