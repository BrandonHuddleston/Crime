How to use the project
---
On Find It! the user can search a city and look up different Places of Interest depending on what they are looking to do around the city. For example the user is looking for a place to stay in the city of Charlotte. All they would have to do is type "Charlotte" in the search bar and just select "Hotels" from the dropdown menu.
